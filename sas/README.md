#`sascalc`
`sascalc` is a part of [SasView](https://github.com/SasView/sasview). It contains modules that are used by an independent package `sasmodels`. As of this writing, `sascalc` is not yet an independent package that can be install using `pip`. 

As a result, `sascalc` is currently added here temporarily for the purpose of running SasView/Bumps fitting headless in FitBenchmarking.
