# FitBenchmarking
FitBenchmarking is an open source tool for comparing different minimizers/fitting frameworks based on their accuracy and runtimes.
Currently, it can be used to compare minimizers in Mantid.

Work is being done to allow this tool to benchmark minimizers from other libraries/software as well.
