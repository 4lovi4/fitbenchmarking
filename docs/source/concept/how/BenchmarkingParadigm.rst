The Benchmarking Paradigm
*************************

      
Once you have chosen which minimizers you want to compare on which problems,
running FitBenchmarking will give you a comparison.

FitBenchmarking will display the results by presenting the user with tables.
A full list of the metrics we use is given in the section :ref:`output`.

There are a number of options that you can pick to customize what your tests
are comparing or how they are run.  A full list of these options, and how to
select them, is given in the section :ref:`options`.
