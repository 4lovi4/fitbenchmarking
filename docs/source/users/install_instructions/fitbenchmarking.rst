Installing FitBenchmarking
##########################

|Python 2.7+| will be needed for running/installing this.

  Note: If using Python 3, Mantid problems and minimizers will be unavailable.
  As such, you should skip step 4.

1. Download this repository or clone it using
   `git <https://git-scm.com/>`__:
   ``git clone https://github.com/mantidproject/fitbenchmarking.git``
2. Open up a terminal (command prompt) and go into the
   ``fitbenchmarking`` directory.
3. Once you are in the right directory, type
   ``pip install .``. If this doesn't work either ``pip`` is not
   in your PATH or not installed. See `here <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__
   for instructions to install ``pip``.
4. Install any additional softwares you wish to benchmark.
   See :doc:`externals` for more information on this.
