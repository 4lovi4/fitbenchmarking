Tables
######

Tables are not currently easily extensible.

In the future, we aim to refactor the table generation to use a base table
class and a factory methodology similar to that used in the parsers and
controllers. Information on this can be found in
`issue #431 <https://github.com/fitbenchmarking/fitbenchmarking/issues/431>`__.
