**SasView**

***How to create calculated data from GUI interface***
Of course see the SasView manual but here for our specific purpose:

* Using SasView 4.2.2
  * In Window 'Fit panel' simply select any Model [ M1 ] which seems then automatically create plot when combo-boxes model selections have been made
  * Right click on plot and select M1 [...] -> Save Points to a File
  * note 3 column is created where all errors comes out as zeros, which obviously than needs to be adjusted
